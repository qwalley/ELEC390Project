# ELEC390Project

A parody website of www.whitehouse.gov

This project will use Node.js to run a web application that scrapes pages from the White House's website, substitutes popular
words for much sillier ones and then host the new pages on the parody website.

## Getting Started

  If the command does not output "v6.something.something" google how to get the latest version of Node.js
