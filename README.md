# ELEC390Project

A parody website of www.whitehouse.gov

This project will use Node.js to run a web application that scrapes pages from the White House's website, substitutes popular
words for much sillier ones and then host the new pages on the parody website.

## Getting Started
1. Verify that you have Node.js installed. In your terminal try:
  ~~~~
  willalley@Wills-MacBook-Pro:~/repo/ELEC390Project$ node -v
  v6.9.1
  ~~~~
  If the command does not output "v6.something.something" google how to get the latest version of Node.js

2. clone repo: `$git clone https://github.com/qwalley/ELEC390Project.git`
3. install dependencies: `$npm install`
